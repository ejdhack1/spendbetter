# Ethical Spending Guide  
## Avoiding Corporations That Backed Trump-Era or Anti-Democratic Policies

**Purpose:**  
Help consumers make everyday purchasing decisions that avoid financially supporting corporations linked to:
- Trump-aligned political funding
- Election denial

## Design Philosophy

This guide follows three principles:

1. **Evidence-based** — all claims trace to public sources  
2. **Practical** — always offer realistic substitutes  
3. **Transparent** — scoring logic and sources are visible

This is not a boycott list.  
It is a **values-aligned decision support tool** for consumers.

---

## Suggested Next Steps for Tool Builders

To turn this into an application:

1. Build a Companies table
2. Store each claim as a separate Signal with source link
3. Compute risk scores from weighted signals
4. Link each category to substitute vendors
5. Allow crowd-submitted evidence with moderation
